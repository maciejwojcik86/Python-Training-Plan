# Introduction to python

## Setup

- Anaconda
there a other tools to manage environments but this is one of most popular and easiest. Once installed Anaconda you already have python and other tools installed. Creating and activating env can be done via windows app or in windows terminal

- Code editor
There are many options With anaconda you will have already VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks, Spyder and other but I recommend to install Cursor and start using it straigh away. It is extension of VS Code for anything that apply to VS Code works with Cursor.

## Introduction to VS Code and Python

great short tutorial how to use it and its options
You dont need to install python as you already have it with anaconda. Same with managing venv.

## Notebooks

by default python code is in scripts .py files where each script can be run as independet app or they can be linked by importing functions or variables from one to another. Thats how whole complicated application is build.

There is another option especially useful for testing, data science or learning: Jupyter Notebooks which allows to code and run small parts of code and see results in the same file. You can use notebooks in browser (Jupyter or Google Colab) or better create .ipynb files (insted of .py) in VS Code (or Cursor)

### First apps to learn

- Always try to copy code from tutorials and run it yourself
- create a lot of different mini projects and save them separately to practice creating environments and always have some previously created tools and lessos for you reference
- Maybe as 1st projects try to process some data in notebooks, import excels .cvs files with pandas, try to decay correct some actity, create graphs with pyplot. This may be already useful at work

## AI with python

### Use LLM as Tutor

Ask chatbots to explain concepts, provide examples and pieces of code which try to run
Paste them errors and ask to explain or fix. You can use them for free:
- https://chatgpt.com/
- https://claude.ai/new
- https://huggingface.co/chat/ 
    (with the best free model: meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-FP8 )
- or directly in Cursor editor

# Training plan according to ChatGPT
I asked ChatGPT to create training plan for you, which is very reasonable, matches what I listed above

my prompt:
```
I build my small python project which is laboratory information management system. I mainly use SQLModel, streamlit as UI and some LLM capabilities like autogen and OpenAI API. I want to involve my friend who has no experience with this at all but can quickly learn. Can you prepare a training plan of concepts he would need to learn? Starting with initial setup ( I recommend anaconda and vs code), up to familiarisation to LLM and packages I mentioned.
```

Certainly! Here's a structured training plan that will help your friend get up to speed with your laboratory information management system (LIMS) project. This plan assumes your friend is familiar with basic programming concepts but has no specific experience with Python, SQLModel, Streamlit, or LLM (Large Language Model) capabilities.
